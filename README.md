## Repository Description
This repository (repo) is dedicated to my homework assignments for UBC's [STAT 545A course](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/) (Winter term 1, 2019). Homework assignments will be named as "hw"+(assignment number)+(version).

:point_right:  __For example:__ 
"hw1.0" means "homework assignment 1, original version" and "hw1.1" means "homework assignment 1, version 1". 

 ___Note:___ version __0__ indicates the original version, while version __1__ indicates that one update has been committed.


### Nice to meet you  :wave:
My name is Hannah McSorley, thanks for visiting my STAT 545 homework repo! Soon, you can check out [my user account](https://github.com/HJMcSorley) to see the evolution of my code. I started learning _R_ in Dan Moore's GEOB 503A (Topics in Geomorphology and Hydrology, UBC 2018), and just started learning about GitHub in STAT 545 (2019). My work might be a bit janky to begin with but I'm constantly working to improve my coding and data management skills!
