## Repository Description
This repository (repo) is dedicated to my homework assignments for UBC's [STAT 545A course](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/) (Winter term 1, 2019). Homework assignments will be named as "hw"+(assignment number).

 ___For example:___ 
"hw01" means "homework assignment 1" 

## GitHub Pages
GitHub pages has been enabled for this repo. 
The root directory URL to view any of my HTML rendered homework assignments is:
https://stat545-ubc-hw-2019-20.github.io/stat545-hw-HJMcSorley/

:point_right: just add the homework file path to view as a web page.

  * e.g. ...stat545-hw-HJMcSorley/path/to/file.html  
      * _where_ "path/to/file.html" _might look like:_ /hw0N/name-of-rmd-file.html
  
### Nice to meet you  
My name is Hannah McSorley, thanks for visiting my STAT 545 homework repo! (Soon) you can check out [my user account](https://github.com/HJMcSorley) to see the evolution of my code. I started learning _R_ in Dan Moore's GEOB 503A (Topics in Geomorphology and Hydrology, UBC 2018), and just started learning about GitHub in STAT 545 (2019). My work might be a bit janky to begin with but I'm constantly working to improve my coding and data management skills!
