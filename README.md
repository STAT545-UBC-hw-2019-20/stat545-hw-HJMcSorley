# Repository Description
This repository (repo) is dedicated to my homework assignments for UBC's [STAT 545-A course](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/) (Winter term 1, 2019). Homework assignements will be named as "hw"+(assignment number)+(version). 
  _For example:_ "hw1.0" means "homework assignment 1, original version"; "hw1.1" means "homework assignment 1, version 1". 

:point_right: ___Note:___ version __0__ indicates the original version, while version __1__ indicates that 1 update has been committed. 

## Nice to meet you  :wave:
Thanks for visiting my STAT 545 homework repo, my name is Hannah McSorley. You can check out [my user account](https://github.com/HJMcSorley) to see the evolution of my code. I started learning _R_ in Dan Moore's GEOB 503A (Topics in Geomorphology and Hydrology, UBC 2018), and I started learning how to use GitHub in STAT 545 (2019). My code might be a bit janky to begin with but I'm trying to improve all the time!
