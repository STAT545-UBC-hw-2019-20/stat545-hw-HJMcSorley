## Homework 01 Folder

This folder is dedicated to STAT 545 [Homework Assignment 1](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/hw01/hw01/) (hw01).

__The objective__ of this assignment was to use the tools of GitHub, R Studio and R Markdown, and git (version control). \

hw01 had three exercises associated with it: 

* __E1__ -- update the homework repo README.md file using markdown
* __E2__ -- Explore the 'gapminder' dataset and create a pdf_document OR github_document output (see ['Tidy Submission'](https://stat545.stat.ubc.ca/evaluation/assignments/)) that showcases the dataset
* __E3__ -- Show the 'gapminder' dataset exploration as a slideshow presentation (e.g. ioslides)
